This was created as a final project for a web publishing course in 2016. The requirements for the site (like embedding a flash and having a table with images and another with links) were absurd and more appropriate for 1996 than 2016, so I decided to run with it and make it as 90's as I could manage while still being TECHNICALLY correct.  We also needed to choose our own theme, so I chose 'wasting time' since...that's what this project was doing. Wasting my time.  That being said, this can be a pretty great example of what NOT to do with a modern website, and it's pretty entertaining in its own right.
